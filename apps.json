This is worked around by re-adding the glob keychain group entitlement. (not guaranteed to work, as I couldn\u2019t reproduce the issue in the first place)\r\n\u2022 Switches in settings not working. Apparently using the private Preference framework causing changes to be saved to the wrong preference file.\r\n\u2022 Some apps may get stuck on a black screen caused by an unknown deadlock. This is worked around by pre-initializing \"UIScreen\".\r\n\u2022 Some apps may fail to create temporary files. This is fixed by redirecting guest app\u2019s temporary directory to that of LiveContainer using symlink instead of creating its own. (thanks @hugeBlack for hinting me the issue)",
